## Overview
The **Healthcare Insurance Prediction** project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict insurance charges based on user demographic and medical information. The project focuses on providing an efficient solution for insurance providers to understand customer profiles and set premium rates more accurately.

## Features
- Predict healthcare insurance charges based on demographic and medical data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding patterns and trends.
- Hyperparameter optimization for improving model performance.
- Comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Statsmodels
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- Age
- Gender
- BMI
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
- Insurance charges (target variable)

Dataset used: [Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) (or specify your dataset source).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/healthcare-insurance-prediction.git
   cd healthcare-insurance-prediction
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python src/train_model.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model and view results in the `outputs/` directory.

## Results
- Model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R2 score).
- Visualizations of feature importance and prediction vs actual plots.

## Future Work
- Implement additional machine learning models.
- Incorporate more features such as medical history and lifestyle factors.
- Develop a user-friendly web or mobile interface for predictions.
